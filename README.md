# Portfolio-Challenge-2

For my portfolio, I wanted to showcase my current work and skills. To guide me in this task, I used the below acceptance criteria:

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

I began by practicing my skill of wireframing to picture how I wanted to layout my portfolio. I came up with this initial and basic design:

<img width="717" alt="wireframe1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115502589/198709588-9edd4a95-f95e-4dfd-aa77-31e45a662577.PNG">

This design made it clear that I would need to develop and use my skills in flexbox and ccs grids, including expanded my understanding of how to implement nested grids.

# Challenges 
 
One of the first challenges I came across was how I was going to tackle this project. I decided on a systematic, top-down approach. I looked at my wireframe and recogised that my first area to work on would be the navigation layout. Ths required me to use flexbox to align my elements as desired. It took me many attempts at trial and error to understand which attributes I needed, which selectors to target and how I wanted each part to sit. In the screenshot below, you can see that I used the inspect tool to help me play with the flexbox features so I could see the impact without changing my code too much. From this, I was able to see where I was going wrong and make corrections to my code. I then decided to tackle the layout of portfolio before adding content, style and responsiveness to my portfolio.

One other challenge is being able to successfully implement media query. Extensive research and trial and error has been unsucessful. I have left the media query in css for anyone to take a look and offer any tips and suggestions so I may extend my learning.

I have also found placing images into the grid extremely difficult when they have not been background images. I have implemented the current knowledge and research I have gathered to allow the first picture to be clickable, but it is not appropriately sized all the time, although it is somewhat responsive to browser sizing. This is the same with the avatar sizing in large screens, although I am proud to have found out how to make a picture circular.


# Things I learned

Although a challenge for me, I took great pride in learning how to layout my portfolio. I conducted plenty of research regarding css grids and nested grids, and with this I was able to gain confidence and understanding in using css grids. I'm a visual person and so I found that I needed to see my new knowledge more clearly on the webpage, and so I coloured each area with a different background colour. This allowed me to understand my mistakes and errors, which in turn allowed me to improve and correct my code.
